Our 86th and 102nd floor Observation Decks offer the two highest vantage points in New York City. Soaring 1,454 feet above Midtown Manhattan from base to antenna, the Empire State Building is the World's Most Famous Office Building. Named America's favorite building in a poll conducted by the American Institute of Architects, the Empire State Building is one of New York City's top tourist destinations. On a clear day, you can see up to five states from our Observation Decks - New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Massachusetts. Guests can enjoy our outdoor viewing area on our open-air 86th floor Observatory, or our indoor climate-controlled viewing areas on the 86th and 102nd floors. We recently launched our new Multimedia Experience as well, which guides visitors through the extraordinary exhibits and breathtaking views with additional depth on the building's history in eight languages - including English, Spanish, French, Italian, Mandarin, Portuguese, Japanese and Korean. The Empire State Building aims to provide entertainment for guests of all ages. Bringing children?

Enjoy romantic tunes from our saxophone player from 9 p.m. until midnight every Thursday through Saturday night. Tickets can be purchased through our website. Our celebrated tower lights are often illuminated to commemorate holidays, events and special causes. In the Fall of 2012, we upgraded our tower lighting system from floodlights to one-of-a-kind LED tower lights. The state-of-the-art system allows customized lighting capabilities from a palette of over 16 million colors! To watch some of our recent light shows, visit our YouTube page. Reigning as the world's tallest building from 1931 to 1970, the Empire State Building is known for its distinct Art Deco style. Construction of the renowned icon only took one year and 45 days, and logged more than 7 million man hours. This is the fastest construction to date for a project of its scale. Additionally, from classics like An Affair to Remember and Sleepless in Seattle to recent hits such as Oblivion and Elf, our place in pop culture has been solidified since our early days. In fact, over 200 movies and TV shows have featured the Empire State Building in them!"

Teed's utopian community of 200 followers relocated from New York to Florida in 1894. Dr. Teed took the name 'Koresh,' the Hebrew translation for Cyrus, meaning shepherd. The colonists believed that the entire universe existed within a giant, hollow sphere. They conducted experiments that seemed to confirm their beliefs. The Koreshans built and operated a printing facility, boat works, cement works, sawmill, bakery, store and hostelry. Education, science and art also helped shape their community. After the death of Dr. Teed in 1908 at the age of 69, membership of his religious group began to decline. In 1961, the four remaining members deeded 305 acres of their land to the state of Florida as a park and memorial. The Koreshan Unity Settlement Historic District is on the National Register of Historic Places."

Unlike common gullies, trenches or sinkholes caused by temporary flooding, the steephead ravine is a permanent feature with a spring-fed creek that never dries up, called Whitewater Branch. The underground water bubbling up cuts into the bank and carries the sand and soil downstream to the St. Johns River. Over thousands of years the ravine has widened and deepened to what you see today. In 1933, this ravine was transformed into a dramatic garden by the federal Works Progress Administration. Much of the original landscaping still exists as formal gardens and an extensive trail system. A 1.8-mile paved road winds around the ravine, offering motorists and bicyclists a view of the gardens. The Ravine Loop is closed to vehicle traffic one hour before sunset, but remains open for pedestrians, bicycles, and wheelchairs. The garden's peak flowering period is azalea season, late January to April. Numerous picnic sites, equipped with tables and grills, are available to visitors. The Roy E.

In the early 1900s scientists, recreationists and nature enthusiasts, recognizing the value and potential of the Indiana dunes area, fought to have the region preserved. As a result, in 1925, the state park was established.Large sand dunes, located beyond the entire shoreline, have taken thousands of years to form, and tower nearly 200 feet above Lake Michigan. A wide range of habitats and plant species are found in the park, with vegetation stabilizing some of the sand. These habitats provide homes for many types of plants and animals. The lake also provides habitat for many aquatic species, as well as a constantly changing fishery.Indiana Dunes State Park features a wide variety of habitats, including beach, sand dunes, black oak forest, wooded wetlands, and a button-bush marsh. Together, these areas contain some of the most diverse flora and fauna in the Midwest. Botanists from across the country enjoy studying the unusual collection of plant life. Other interesting features include “tree graveyards” (places where forests have been buried by sand and then, more recently, re-exposed by wind erosion). “Tree graveyards” can be seen in Big Blowout, near Trail 10. The Indiana Dunes area also is renowned throughout the Midwest for its birding. Visit the Nature Center to ask about good birding locations.Indiana Dunes State Park is surrounded by Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, a federally administered park comprising approximately 15,000 acres."

Then in the late 1920s, Arthur Chaffin, owner/operator of the Hite ferry, and two companions were searching for an alternative route between Green River and Caineville. They came to a vantage point about a mile west of Goblin Valley and were awed by what they saw, five buttes and a valley of strange-shaped rock formations surrounded by a wall of eroded cliffs. In 1949, Chaffin returned to the area he called Mushroom Valley. He spent several days exploring the mysterious valley and photographing its scores of intricately eroded creatures. The area was acquired by the state of Utah and in 1964 was officially designated a state park. Goblin Valley State Park is a showcase of geologic history. Exposed cliffs reveal parallel layers of rock bared by erosion. Because of the uneven hardness of sandstone, some patches resist erosion much better than others. The softer material is removed by wind and water, leaving thousands of unique, geologic goblins. Water erosion and the smoothing action of windblown dust work together to shape the goblins. Bedrock is exposed because of the thin soil and lack of vegetation. When rain does fall, there are few plant roots and little soil to capture and hold the water, which quickly disappears, in muddy streams without penetrating the bedrock. Opened to the public as a state park in 1964. Park Elevation - 5,000 feet"

We have found the traditional equipment and materials we use to be durable, functional and in many ways preferable to today's high technology outdoor equipment. The craftsmanship that goes into our equipment is an extension of the care we put into each of our trips. We have traveled extensively in the north with the Cree and Inuit and many of the techniques we use for northwoods and tundra travel were developed by them. Mahoosuc Guide Service offers a wide variety of activities for all seasons and levels of experience."

                   The Ozark region is rich with history and has long been the subject of study to historians, geologists, anthropologists, and archeologists. Before the French fur trappers explored the area and European descendants began settling here, the people of the Osage tribe populated much of the land now known as Southern Missouri and Northern Arkansas. Other tribes, traveling through the region, traded with the Osage and left behind clues of their passage. Arrowheads were abundant in the area, and a large collection of over 10,000 hunting implements and artifacts were collected by the Arlis Cogar family who established the Trail of Tears Museum in Huntsville, AR. In 1993, the Prier family of Golden, MO, took over the Trail of Tears Museum Collection and combined it with their collection of Carnival Glass and American pioneer artifacts to create the Golden Missouri Pioneer Museum. The Prier family continues to expand the collection with unique and interesting collections.
                  



                   The Golden Pioneer Museum gives the visitor a unique look into the lives of early Americans, both Native and the settlers who came in the 1800s.

                   * There are many other collections in the museum that include pocket watches, baseball cards, watches, guns, lunch boxes, rose bowls, as well as Civil War battlefield items.
                  



                   In addition to the man-made treasures, the museum has a large collection of rare mineral items such as the following:

This state park is a National Historic Landmark. Chief Plenty Coups (Aleek-chea-ahoosh, meaning ""many achievements"") was a man of war - and then a man of peace - whose vision has helped bridge a gap between two cultures. Recognized for his bravery and leadership, he was made a chief of the Apsáalooke (Crow) tribe by age 28. When Chief Plenty Coups gave up his nomadic ways in 1884, he became one of the first Apsáalooke to own and settle on a farm, which was deeded to him through the federal Indian Allotment Act. On his 320-acre tract, located a half mile east of Pryor, he opened a general store, built a home, and tilled the earth until his death in 1932 at age 84. At that time, as requested by Chief Plenty Coups and his wife, Strikes the Iron, 195 acres of his land was made into a public park. Upon his death, the Apsáalooke people voted to designate him as their last traditional tribal chief. Plan at least an hour to walk the grounds and browse through the Visitor Center that commemorates the life of this remarkable man and his efforts to lead his people into bridging the gap between two cultures and transition from a tipi and buffalo to a settled reservation lifestyle. Walk the 3/4 mile trail around the park along beautiful Pryor Creek.The tranquil, shaded picnic area is a beautiful spot to enjoy lunch and absorb the serenity of this special place.

                   Located on the shores of beautiful Chautauqua Lake, Midway State Park is a family treasure. Originally established in 1898 as a trolley park, Midway State Park is one of the oldest continually operating amusement parks in the nation. The first owners of the park constructed playing fields, tennis courts, bath houses and a dance hall to entice customers to ride the trolley on weekends. In 1915, a new building was constructed with a kitchen, a large dining room and space for dancing and roller skating. Today, this building is home to a museum, gift shop, concession stands and other facilities.
                  



                   Midway State Park continues to offer the same family friendly atmosphere that visitors have come to love. Patrons can take a nostalgic ride on the vintage carousel, play a game of mini golf, take a spin on the tilt-a whirl, ride the go-karts and bumper boats or watch their children enjoy themselves on the many kiddie rides. And, while some may prefer to relax while enjoying an old fashioned candy apple or cotton candy, others can test their skills at classic midway games.
                  



                   Several picnic shelters are available for family reunions and company picnics. Accessible by the waters of Chautauqua Lake, Midway also is a great place for fishing and free docking is offered for day visitors.

                   Fort Abraham Lincoln State Park in North Dakota is one of the outstanding historic areas within the state.

                   Fort Abraham Lincoln State Park is located 7 miles south of Mandan, ND, on Highway 1806.

Exhibitions Include: Permanent Exhibition: The Holocaust Spanning three floors, the self-guided Permanent Exhibition presents a narrative history of the Holocaust and features historical artifacts, photographs, and film footage. Personal objects and the concluding eyewitness testimonies highlight the stories of individuals. Recommended for ages 11 or older. The Portal: A Real-Time Conversation with People Forced to Flee Persecution The Shared Studios Portal allows you to have a face-to-face conversation with someone in another part of the world-as if you are standing in the same room. Through this installation, visitors will be able to converse in real time with displaced persons or refugees in Iraq, Jordan, and Germany Remember the Children: Daniel's Story Representing the experiences of many Jewish children during the Nazi era, ""Daniel"" narrates through his diary the history of the Holocaust in ways that children can understand. Recreated environments present life in a middle-class German home, in a Jewish ghetto in occupied Poland, and finally at the Auschwitz concentration camp. The exhibition is explicit without being graphic. Recommended for ages 8 or older. Some Were Neighbors: Collaboration & Complicity in the Holocaust Some Were Neighbors: Collaboration & Complicity in the Holocaust addresses one of the central questions about the Holocaust: How was it possible? The central role of Hitler and other Nazi Party leaders is indisputable. Less well understood is these perpetrators' dependence on countless others for the execution of Nazi racial policies. Within Nazi Germany and across German-dominated Europe, circles of collaboration and complicity rippled throughout governments and societies wherever victims of persecution and mass murder lived."

                   We continually seek to:
                  



                   • Provide areas in our County for outdoor laboratories where plants, animals and entire ecosystems can be studied;
                  

                   • Sponsor and participate in educational programs, ecological research, and classroom teaching;
                  

                   • Cooperate with other agencies and organizations concerned with environmental education and;
                  

                   • Provide leadership training programs in the field of conservation, environmental education and natural history.
                  



                   The Education Center is located at the County-owned Kettle Creek Wildlife Sanctuary near Bartonsville. This 13,000 sq. foot facility contains the Administrative and Technical offices of the Conservation District. It also houses the Kettle Creek Environmental Education Center on its second floor. Over 7,200 sq. ft. of space is devoted to educational programs including two large classroom/meeting areas, offices, kitchen, public restrooms and numerous displays and exhibits on the Pocono's natural environment.
                  



                   The Center also contains a gift shop with many different educational and environmentally oriented items for sale including a large selection of birdfeeders, quality birdseed, field guides and more. On the outside of the building is a large observation deck and additional classroom area. Many different educational programs are offered year-round. The building is open Monday - Friday, 8am - 4:30pm and most Saturdays from 9am - 1pm.
                  



                   The Kettle Creek Wildlife Sanctuary itself is a 166 acre preserve. The initial 120 acres was donated for the preservation of wildlife by Clayton Swink. And an additional 46 acres was purchased in 2004. It is now managed by the Conservation District and provides an interesting arena for outdoor programs. It has old field, mature deciduous forest, evergreen stands, and two ponds. Over 2 1/2 miles of maintained and well-marked trails are open for public use year-round, 7 days a week.
                  



                   The Education Center also utilizes “satellite sites” in Monroe County. The Meesing site is a 100 acre tract located on the Delaware State Forest north of Marshalls Creek. Owned by the PA Bureau of Forestry and maintained by the Conservation District the area encompasses a variety of diverse habitats. There is a large clear-cut where a young forest is emerging, a stand of pines, a small swamp, a stream, a pond, and a maple forest complete with a Sugar Shack that is used to produce sweet maple syrup each March. Two miles of trails are open to the public year-round, dawn to dusk, for passive recreation and nature study.
                  



                   Kettle Creek Environmental Education Center educators also provide interpretive tours of The Nature Conservancy’s Tannersville Cranberry Bog. Access to the fragile area is limited. The floating boardwalk provides a unique opportunity to see the interior of the bog. Tours are held throughout the year for the general public as well as private and school groups."

But Washington Crossing Historic Park represents much more than a single event. Restored Colonial buildings in the park, such as the Thompson-Neely House and McConkey Ferry Inn, give many clues about living conditions during the Revolutionary era. Later, homes and shops reveal how 19th-century rural Pennsylvanians lived and worked. Among them are the home of a prosperous merchant, a village general store, and homes for skilled artisans.

As such, it is a surprisingly accurate reflection of our culture 100 years ago. The children's room looks like the children have just stepped out for a few minutes. The parlor waits for visiting callers. Outside, the roses of earlier generations still bloom; the herbs still rise in the springtime.
                  



                   Jefferson County Historical Society offers walking tours of Port Townsend's historic uptown. This tour, covering the ""Moral High Ground,"" the genteel district up on the bluff in this once-notorious seaport, starts from the Rothschild House every Sunday at 2 pm, June through September. Please call ahead to ensure your reservation.
                  



                   The Rothschild House is managed by Jefferson County Historical Society. The JCHS staffs the house, while Washington State Parks provides maintenance and oversight."

The name Beartown was chosen because local residents claimed that the many cave-like openings in the rocks made ideal winter dens for the black bears of the area. Also, the many deep, narrow crevasses were formed in a somewhat regular criss-cross pattern and appear from above like the streets of a small town. Beartown is noted for its unusual rock formations, which are comprised of Droop, or Pottsville, Sandstone formed during the Pennsylvanian age. Massive boulders, overhanging cliffs, and deep crevasses stir the imagination of most visitors. Pocketing the face of the cliffs are hundreds of eroded pits, ranging from the size of marbles to others large enough to hold two grown men. Ice and snow commonly remain in the deeper crevasses until mid to late summer. Vegetation clings tenaciously to life, sending roots into mere cracks in the rocks.The land was purchased in 1970 with funds from the Nature Conservancy and a donation from Mrs. Edwin G. Polan, in memory of her son, Ronald Keith Neal, who lost his life in the Vietnam War. Development of the park has been minimal in order to preserve the natural attractions of the area. However, basic facilities are provided, and a boardwalk permits easy access. Interpretive signs along the boardwalk guide visitors and provide insights concerning the ecology of the area. The park is open daily from April to October. During the closed winter season foot travel to the boardwalk area is welcome, with parking available at the closed entrance gate. Group tours may be arranged by contacting the Superintendent at nearby Droop Mountain Battlefield State Park. No fee is charged to visit Beartown."

Five are around the lake. All campgrounds include comfort stations, picnic tables, fire grills and drinking water. We also have a trailer dump station located at the south entrance to Guernsey State Park. This park provides the finest examples of Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) work in the Rocky Mountain area. Built by the CCC, the Guernsey Museum, the Castle and Brimmer Point are available to explore. The museum is perched on a high cliff, overlooking the water. The building itself is made of hand hewn timbers and hand forged iron. The roof is framed with the timbers and covered with split cedar shakes, and the floors were formed by pieces of smooth flagstone. The Castle, with its giant fireplace and winding steps, leads to an observation area for a spectacular view of the park.An extensive network of trails was originally planned and partially built during the operation of the CCC camps. Ever since that time hiking and trail use has been a major feature at Guernsey State Park. Approximately ten miles of CCC trails have been restored on the park. Starting point for the trail system is at the Brimmer Point turnoff. The trail system consists of several loops which provide a variety of scenic views of the park, reservoir and the dam. Most of the trails are moderately physically demanding.The Oregon Trail was one of the primary routes used by the immigrants' westward migration across the plains from 1841 to 1869. Today, in many parts of Wyoming, remnants of The Oregon Trail can still be seen. Some of the best examples are the ""ruts""; located just 1/2 mile south of the town of Guernsey, off Highway 26.Register Cliff located two miles southeast of Guernsey provided travelers with a ""chalkboard"" where they placed their names for those who followed. The landmark still remains much the way it looked to pioneers on wagon trains journeying West."
